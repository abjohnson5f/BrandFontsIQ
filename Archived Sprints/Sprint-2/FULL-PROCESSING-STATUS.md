# Full Dataset Processing Status

## Current Status

**Started at**: 2:35 PM EDT
**Estimated completion**: 3:05-3:15 PM EDT (30-40 minutes)

### Agent 1 (PID: 80597)
- Status: PROCESSING
- Progress: ~4% (95 of 2,135 rows)
- Log file: `trees/company_id_v3-1/full-process.log`
- Output will be: `trees/company_id_v3-1/output/Polaris_CompanyID_Enriched.xlsx`

### Agent 3 (PID: 80776)  
- Status: PROCESSING
- Log file: `trees/company_id_v3-3/full-process.log`
- Output will be: `trees/company_id_v3-3/output/Polaris_CompanyID_Enriched_Full.xlsx`

## What This Will Prove

1. **Full capability**: Processing all 2,135 rows, not just 50-row samples
2. **Actual performance**: Real timing and API costs
3. **Data integrity**: The Website/App Title column is NOT being modified (already verified)
4. **Company identification**: The empty "Company" column will be filled with identified companies

## To Monitor Progress

```bash
# Agent 1 progress
tail -f /Users/alexjohnson/Dev Projects/GitHub/BrandFontsIQ-vNextJS15/trees/company_id_v3-1/full-process.log

# Agent 3 progress  
tail -f /Users/alexjohnson/Dev Projects/GitHub/BrandFontsIQ-vNextJS15/trees/company_id_v3-3/full-process.log

# Check if still running
ps -p 80597 80776
```

## Why Previous Analysis Failed

1. I saw output files but didn't verify they contained full results
2. Agent 3's file had 2,135 rows but only 50 were actually processed
3. I assumed completion without checking the actual data

This time we're running the full processing to completion with monitoring.
