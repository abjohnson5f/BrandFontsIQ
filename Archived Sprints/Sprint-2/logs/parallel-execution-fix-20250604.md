# Parallel Execution Fix - June 4, 2025

## Issue Summary
The `/simple-init-parallel` command was failing because it contained the old 5-step pattern with PORT echo commands that were supposed to be removed after Sprint 1.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Command Drift**: The `.claude/commands/simple-init-parallel.md` file had not been updated after Sprint 1 success
2. **PORT Echo Problem**: The command included `echo "PORT=300X" >> .env.local` which breaks Next.js
3. **Manual Workaround**: Claude ended up using Task tool to manually execute the correct 4-step pattern

## Timeline
- Sprint 1 (June 1): Discovered 4-step pattern works, 5-step pattern fails
- June 3: PARALLEL-AGENT-CORRECT-PROCESS.md documented the correct pattern
- June 4: Command file still had old 5-step pattern
- June 4: Fixed command file to match Sprint 1 success pattern

## Fix Applied
Updated `/simple-init-parallel` command to use the correct 4-step pattern:
1. Create worktree
2. Copy .env.local
3. Run npm install
4. Update next.config.js port

Removed the problematic `echo "PORT=300X" >> .env.local` step.

## Lessons Learned
- Command files must be updated immediately when patterns are validated
- Documentation (PARALLEL-AGENT-CORRECT-PROCESS.md) was correct but implementation lagged
- Manual workarounds hide underlying issues

## Verification
The command should now work correctly without requiring restarts or manual intervention.
