## Key Achievements

1. **All agents passed the critical Aixam dealer test** - the make-or-break requirement
2. **Real API calls worked** - No authentication errors
3. **High accuracy**: 82-90% identification rates
4. **Cost effective**: ~$0.004 per company
5. **Fast processing**: Minutes vs weeks of manual work

## Differences in Approach

- **Agent 1**: Focus on pattern matching efficiency
- **Agent 2**: Added dealer/subsidiary flags for richer data
- **Agent 3**: Included detailed performance metrics and cost analysis

## Recommendation

Agent 3's approach provides the best balance of:
- Clear performance metrics (like you requested)
- Cost transparency
- Parent company relationships
- High accuracy (90%)

For future sprints, we should follow Agent 3's example of providing concrete metrics and actual test outputs as proof of functionality.
